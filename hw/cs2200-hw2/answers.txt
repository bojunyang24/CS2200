Question 1
----------
jalr $ra, $at
The JALR instruction stores the incremented PC into the register $ra and loads the PC with the value in the register $at.

lea $ra, nextinstruction
beq $zero, $zero, labelx
nextinstruction:
labelx: beq $zero, $zero, labely
labely:beq $zero, $zero, labelz
.
.
.
lablez: desired address in $at


The lea instruction emulates storing the incremented pc into a $ra by using a "nextinstruction" label that corresponds to the incremented PC.
The beq instruction is an unconditional branch to the a memory address specified by labelx. If the memory address is further away than the maximum offset allowed, we can chain more unconditional branches until we reach the desired address.
Since there is no instruction that allows us to load a value from a register into the PC, we must assume the value in $at corresponds to a label.
